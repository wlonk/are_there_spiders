Notes from Joe:

ATS is looking great. I'll send you some intro text soon, if you'd like.

I'm thinking that the "Reviews" tab should maybe instead be called "List of
Media" - since we're not really reviewing stuff, we're just informing people
of what contains spiders.

I noticed in the first version that each entry was titled "Review of [X]".
It'd be better if it was just titled "[X]". Repeating "Review of" in every
entry becomes redundant quickly.

If a user were to submit a review of Limbo, and I were to have a different
review... is there a way to sync those reviews up? An ideal might look like:
the Limbo review page having an "add to this review" button, and if I try to
post a new Limbo review the system saying "Would you like to add this review
to the existing Limbo (2011) page?" I don't know how easy that would be. The
alternative is just to allow for multiple Limbo (2011) reviews that don't
interact. That's fine too.

Those are just some thoughts I have at the moment. More to come! I'm excited
about this site-to-be.
